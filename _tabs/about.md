# __Welcome!__

Welcome to the Museum of **Video Game Shape Research and Esoterica** (hereafter referred to as **the Shapes Museum**).

Did you know there are a lot of shapes? That makes sorting through them challenging. Rather than establishing a bar on the “quality” of a good shape, we investigate *niche* shapes.

There are a lot of shapes that people don’t want you to see. Shapes that hide behind walls, beneath your floorboards. You have probably been in the same room as a shape and you didn’t even know it. These are the shapes that you can expect to see stripped bare and plinthed in the Shapes Museum.

We have a backlog of exhibits, mostly from *Final Fantasy XIV* and *Warframe*. These shapes have been previously gathered for private viewing, but a platform that can publish them has been presented

The Shapes Museum is a not-for-profit foundation that runs only as the curator can temper their hyperfixation. Exhibitions will be sporadic but intense.

## Preface

Now I get to actually *write* about my hyperfixation! Shapes! And what they mean to *Final Fantasy XIV*, the game that you've all heard the copypasta about, and has recently hired someone who identifies as something that **a lot** of weird people online are getting irrationally mad about. (I love Wuk Lamat. She is the perfect idiot. I'm glad she's the protagonist when *we're* out of the spotlight.)


As of writing, my ability to get new shapes is crippled by the interfaces for getting them (Dalamud plus Cammy, and also Splatoon for in-game diagrams) being currently broken following Patch 7.1. There will be plenty of backlog to go through from when the Shapes Museum was a private Discord-only repository. I hope you'll enjoy reading about them. Then again, I don't care. I have to listen to my brain rail off about inane shit, and now you do as well.

Naturally, **there will be spoilers.** These documents assume you have seen just about all the game has to offer. If you haven't, then I hope the title of each post will provide enough context for you to make the call.


## Shapes? A background.

Right. Shapes. I'm not joking about them. They're mostly cubes, and sometimes pointy. You never see them because they are far removed from the game environment. They are always empty, and are far out-of-bounds. You need strong shenanigans to reach a cube - if there is no valid ground somewhere beneath the player, then they are not allowed to move there. It looks like an invisible wall that you'll run on the spot at. If you teleport into this zone, you'll essentially be cast in stasis. You will either need to hack your way out (using the same method you got in), or use the Data Center Travel/Recall in the Character Menu to return to a homestate Aetheryte.

You can experiment with this yourself. In an area that you have decoration rights to (an Apartment, Private Chamber, Estate Hall, Free Company House, or your *Endwalker*-mandated Private Island (to a lesser extent).), if you place a bed through the wall and ``/doze`` near, you will snap through the wall to lay on it. Jump off. Welcome to the void. It's safe - you won't fall forever, but you may be trapped.

I will probably write up a technology glossary on how to do these things yourself.

Anyway, in the big outside, the developers often hide a shape. I don't know what the shape is for, but experience tells me that it's an instantiation pool (a place where things live until needed; teleported into the map) or a dev-cube (a place that holds the logic and mechanism of the map).

The shape *normally* exists along one axis, usually below the center of the map, and normally 512 or 1024 units away in whatever the dominant direction is. They have a very small render radius - they won't appear unless the camera is very close. There are probably more I haven't discovered, but included are the ones that I have. Obviously.

## Author's note

Yes. This is insanely against the TOS. and I'm sure Squeenix would be mad at me if they found this. But I am ascribing to the trapdoor excuse that Yoshi-P provides: If you *are* going to contravene the rules, do not damage the experience for other players. No grief, no unfair advantages. No reason for the Square Special Task Force a reason to get mad. 
I hope they *won't* be mad. This is a project of weird, arcane passion and genuine respect for the game. I am a Mentor and I wear the crown honestly. If you want to reach me in game:

## Afterword
It's nice to upload something through my new form that isn't me bitching about how uncooperative Jekyll was. Gues they should'a called it 'Hyde', amirite? *\*canned laughter\**
(Also, my boyfriend clocked off early, so I'm left to hyperfixate, and I might as well RP 'being productive'.)
