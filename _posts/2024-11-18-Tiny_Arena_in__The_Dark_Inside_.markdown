There is a small facsimile of the area in The Dark Inside (the battle against Zodiark-Fandaniel).  
If I had to guess, it's probably to hold the mechanic of the arena being spun beneath the players' feet.  

This large "real" version (dead Zodiark also included) is about 21 Units wide.

And for scale, the ring around the player's feet when self-targeting is 1 Unit in diameter.

This tiny platform would only be able to fit four of me, and it's very low down.
