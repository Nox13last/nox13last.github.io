I am becoming increasingly certain that these cubes are to do with scenery changes. This one is Sigmascape V4.0 (Kefka Palazzo).  
The scenery is usually only a nebulous void. On the third movement of the song, this becomes a cosmic latte (reminiscent of the sky in the original game).

Also detected: *this indescribably small pointy thing.*

How small? The radius of the player's "targeted" circle is 0.5 units.

Taking the triangular shape of this thing and tracing the smallest circle I possibly can around it, it comes up to roughly 0.07 units.  

The bottom of the skybox (beyond which there is this ugly green void) is about 1796 units below the arena. And some of the corrupted Aether Crystals clip through the skybox.
