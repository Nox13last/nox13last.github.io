So, some background about the background of Alexander: Soul of the Creator.  
You fight a small avatar of Alexander. And during the fight, it sends soldiers back through time to "free you from the prison of time".  
Earlier in the series, the Warrior of Light and their retinue of Garlond Ironworks are frozen-in-time by the Illuminati, staring right down the barrel of a lethal attack. Inexplicably, time resumes soon enough for them to get out of the way. It's not explained why this has happened. 
 
*This* battle shows that it was your own interference, here and now, that breaks the spell. You're busy fighting enemies, but you can see this cutscene, frozen, in the background.  

Even if you don't get to see the encounter, the cutscene uses you as an actor.

_The "me" in this image is that actor. It uses whatever the player has on at the time of this Raid._  

You are pulled back to the present. During the transition, you can see yourself and your retinue (again) glare in surprise and dive out of the way of the attack.  

After this, the non-Alexander actors freeze in place, and then disappear.

(Just as an aside, if you fail to eliminate these enemies in time, you are paradox'd out of the battle because past-you actually died in that cutscene without present-you and present-your present-party to save past-you. How polite.)  

Also as an aside, it looks like this cutscene zone uses the entire arena for another battle (specifically, The Heart of the Creator ('A11', for short)). It has entire parts like the conveyor belts that the players ride from the pre-battle to the boss-battle.

I'll have to go to A11 and see if I can find the battlefield for *this* raid above it.

Finally, and for the biggest affront to shapes, none of the gears that make up the clockwork of this arena have mating teeth. *These* two (directly under the pillar the arena stands on) specifically clash with each other!
