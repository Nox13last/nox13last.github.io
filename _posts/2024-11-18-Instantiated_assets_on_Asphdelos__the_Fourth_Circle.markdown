*Asphodelos: The Fourth Circle* involves the boss covering one or more quadrants of the arena with a cape and pulling it to show a stage hazard. The arena itself is geometrically composed of four black cubes (so the "wells" that are spawned are able to have a depth that doesn't clip against the ground). But also stored in this space is the cape asset that is used in the attack. It's square, but is distorted so the straight edges are inside the arena, and the tattered edges are on the outside.  
In order to show the full cape, my camera is straddling the line between two quadrants - the black line.

Here is that cape as seen on the boss.

Oh. And a dev cube for good measure. Stored at exactly 100,100,-300.

The skybox texture is incredibly vivid. It scrolls very quickly and pulses so luridly that it's difficult to look at. I presume it has to be so garish as to be visible through the stained-glass windows. FIREBLU-ass eyesore.
