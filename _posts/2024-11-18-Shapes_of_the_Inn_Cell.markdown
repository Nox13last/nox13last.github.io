Found this in (or, rather, *out of*) the Drowning Wench Inn.  
![Image](/Wench_1.png){: width="600" }

It's a cube with its normals facing *outwards* for a change.  
![Image](/Wench_2.png){: width="600" }

I have not detected a cube outside of the Quicksands's inn room.  
And I remember so little of (or care so little for) Gridania that I can't remember what *its* inn is called, much less what the interior of it looks like.

There's a wood slab underneath the Gridania Inn. It's the floor-texture.  
![Image](/Roost_1.png){: width="600" }  

Also, just as a more general observation, indoor cells are all in a box. Not sure why.

I thought it'd be to block the skybox box. But it doesn't do that.  
Maybe if there were other rooms in the same map (there aren't, here), it would make it difficult to see one from the other.

Editor's note: Drowned City of Skalla does this as well. In mapping nomenclature, this is known as *daiper-skyboxing*. It really causes efficiency deficits. Don't do this if your game engine is particular about light calculations. Your more discerning players will hate you.

(Sigmascape V1.0 (the Phantom Train) does it, too. But it does have a reason: each player has an assigned cabin inside the train where they go after they get grabbed by the ghoulies. This will be written about in another article.)
