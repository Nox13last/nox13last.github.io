There's a Zurvan under the arena!

The arena is unchanged between Normal and Extreme variants of this fight. Zurvan is always placed there. This Zurvan would be exposed (somewhat) if the slice of arena above him fell away in the same manner as the other quadrants of the arena do. But because this slice never breaks, there is no need to hide Zurvan any better. (I'd argue that, in the absence of more information, there's no reason to hide Zurvan "at all", but there you have him.)  

Furthermore, in all relevant phase transitions (Zurvan being released, and Zurvan's big flashy ice break attack), the players aren't transported from arena to arena. In fact. the arena shapes are swapped out underfoot, and in the phase transition, the players are propelled upwards slightly to make it seem like they are falling into Zurvan's realm.  

Also, I don't think they ever get named or labelled, but the Zurvan duplicates that are involved in the battle (including, it seems, the one in restraints that you fight) are all named 'Infinity'. The under-Zurvan is not named.
