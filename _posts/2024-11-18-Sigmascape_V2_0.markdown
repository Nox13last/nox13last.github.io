{: .prompt-info }

I have found a most interesting shape in Sigmascape V2.0 (Chadarnook).  
![Image](/Sigma_V2_1.png){: width="600" }

There's nothing remarkable about the battlefield. Nothing behind the portrait, a pointy bit about six ilms under the carpet.  
But the--  
Where did it go?  
I was typing, and *the shape disappeared when I looked back.*  
**Whuh?**  
Good one, fuckers. I guess they despawn after ten minutes.


*(Four minutes pass. In order to capture the cryptids, I refought Chadarnook.)*

Anyway, here they are. These minions(?) exist down the corridor pictured above-left. They bob up and down rapidly.  
![Image](/Sigma_V2_2.png){: width="600" }  

They don't seem to exist as objects as Splatoon (the plugin I use for diagramming things) recognises them. That is, there's no flashing tether as it applies to all entities targetable and otherwise.  
But-- YOU SHITS I SAW THAT.

At *some* point, they mobilise and move down the hall. Video incoming.  

There they go. The flashing red circles are Splatoon's search function. It's highlighting all entities in render-range. These minions do not light up.

In other news, this is the exact opposite of "obscured shape". The hitbox for the elemental painting extends *far, far back*. I assume this is so that they disappear if the camera approaches them from behind. Some sort of pseudo-culling effect so you can see past them into the arena if the camera would be behind them. Crude, but effectively making use of the engine's own proclivity to cull-out objects and people that the camera is colliding against.

Behind the portrait of the Goddess Chadarnook in the wall, there's an unknown object.  
![Image](/Sigma_V2_5.png){: width="600" }  
Pictured is Splatoon highlighting it. The small, dim blip is the label for the name of the thing (if applicable). This thing is nameless.  

And apart from the customary Shape, there is nothing else of note.  
![Image](/Sigma_V2_6.png){: width="600" }  

The pointy thing exists at coordinates (0,0,-4.5). It is the closest Shape so far.  

The minions seem to first travel about T+7 minutes (that is, 7 minutes after the duty loads, or about T-83:00 until it times-out), and they seem to loop every **twenty** minutes.  
I looked over to see if I'd put my Splatoon notes down properly, and they entered my field of view again, at about T-63:00.   
Could be on a subdivision of that interval, and this is simply the one that I managed to catch.
