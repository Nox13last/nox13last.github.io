Like with the fight with Honey B. Lovely, the spectators are heavily stylised. Here's a close-up of them.

_I'm going to tell my niblings that these are the spectators that watch the Splatoon Splatfests._

Also like Honey B. Lovely's fight, graphics pertaining to the crowd (known in this artistic context as 'manpu' elements) are stored far beneath the arena.

_The cube is not a manga expression, as far as I know. It SHOULD be. I'd read it._

And a shot of where this area is in relation to the arena.
