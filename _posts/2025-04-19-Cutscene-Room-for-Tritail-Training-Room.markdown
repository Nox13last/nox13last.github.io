A new cutscene room has been added for Tritails Training Room (your base of operations for the Arcadion Ascension Championship arc). The area the player can access is bottom-right in the below shot. I'm fairly sure it was not there prior to _Seekers of Eternity._

_No idea why it's such a strange relative position._

Unlike the normal room, this one is modelled on the exterior, despite still being obscured within a cube. It has quite a lot of geometry.

_Why is this room so craggy?_

This cutscene room is used for the Brute Bomber's heel event-horizon moment (where he punches the commentator and starts going ham on souls). This room is probably supposed to be somewhere in the Colosseum.

_FOV increased to encapsulate the whole room._

_And the room as it's used in cutscene, for context._

Despite the camera being restrictive (this is a forced-angle scene because it is being transmitted via video-drone), the furniture and props are high-quality. Nothing is back-culled like you'd expect.

_Widgets galore_

And naturally, the stools are non-functional.
