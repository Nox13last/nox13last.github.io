I'm lookin' for one.
I tried to install Disqus, because Jekyll supposedly has integration for it out of the gate (and vice versa). But I've seen better documentation at the present-day Library of Alexandria. Completely contradictory sources state how the shortname should be declared in the site config, Jekyll doesn't mention Disqus at all, Disqus omits the shortname and just says to embed it, Peter says it's ``disqus_shortname:``, Paul says it's ``disqus: shortname:``, John says it's ``disqus_username``, and SURPRISE MOTHERFUCKER, THEY'RE ALL JUDAS.
Combined with the apparent tracking protection nightmare that Disqus apparently is embroiled in. I added exceptions to (and eventually disabled) Firefox, Brave, Edge, NordVPN, *and* MalwareBytes. At that point, I've just accepted that Disqus does not want to run. C'est la vie.

Any recommendations, hit me up through Bluesky.
