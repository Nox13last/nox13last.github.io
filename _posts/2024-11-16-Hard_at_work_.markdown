Hello world! Chief Shapewizard here!

I'm excited to have a repository and a front end. I've been working for the past day-and-a-bit, figuring out Github Pages, Jekyll, and Node.js to kitbash together something I don't have to manually edit and add posts and then enter git commands.

I wish I could say it was down to my own ingenuity and capacity to learn, but much of it was asking ChatGPT to do it.
I doubt the process was quite as intensive as image generation, so in a way, I'm *helping* the rainforests.

This is the longest thing I've written for the submission form, and as a proof of concept, it even comes with a stupid picture that's been on my hard drive for decades.
I look forward to actual publications soon.
