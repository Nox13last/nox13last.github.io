I finally remembered to document this one. To the right of the Broker counter, there's a stained-glass hatch. The fact that it opens is pretty obvious, given its design, but I have never seen it open.  
Inside the hatch is a contraption of four numbered dials (in base-10, of course). There was probably an idea to use this to announce a week's winning numbers, but it seems to have never materialised.

There's a space in front of this counter with one major entity and four minor entities. These certainly correspond to the dials.

Also, the name of the NPC standing and staring at this derelict object is 'Lady Luck'. No other NPCs nearby (including the patrons sitting at the tables) are named. She also has an FFXIV-CGW article, but is not implicated in any quests.
The whole thing feels vestigial.

_Apologies for the laser show. I can't tell Splatoon what **not** to see._

And for some reason, there are six entities around the central cactuar statue. Maybe they're fireworks pots for if you win the jackpot? I wouldn't know. :')
