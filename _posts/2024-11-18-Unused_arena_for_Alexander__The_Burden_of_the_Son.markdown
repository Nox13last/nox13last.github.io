There is a part of the arena of *Alexander: The Burden of the Son* (welcome to the hypest industrial ska you'll ever liste--*BRUTE JUSTICE TRANS MODE*) that doesn't get used.

It's these large ducts in the wall. They lead into a chamber that isn't textured properly, and opens out into the void.

This appears to be a reused blueprint for *The Burden of the Father* (where the Off-Tank and a DPS are pulled through those ducts and are imprisoned, until they can earn their freedom to rejoin the battle).
