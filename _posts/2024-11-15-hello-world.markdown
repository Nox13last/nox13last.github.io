## Maintenance Note:
**This is going to be slow-going. Motivation doesn't come often, and I barely know how to use Github.**

Welcome to the Museum of **Video Game Shape Research and Esoterica** (hereafter referred to as **the Shapes Museum**).

Did you know there are a lot of shapes? That makes sorting through them challenging. Rather than establishing a bar on the "quality" of a good shape, we investigate *niche* shapes.

There are a lot of shapes that people don't want you to see. Shapes that hide behind walls, beneath your floorboards. You have probably been in the same room as a shape and you didn't even know it. These are the shapes that you can expect to see stripped bare and plinthed in the Shapes Museum.

We have a backlog of exhibits, mostly from *Final Fantasy XIV* and *Warframe*. These shapes have been previously gathered for private viewing, but a platform that can publish them has been presented


The Shapes Museum is a not-for-profit foundation that runs only as the curators can temper our hyperfixation. Exhibitions will be sporadic but intense.
