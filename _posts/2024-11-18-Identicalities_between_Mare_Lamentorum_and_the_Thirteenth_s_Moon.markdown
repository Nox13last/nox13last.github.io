(This was originally posted on 29 August 2023. Also, can we come up with a name for this zone? Mare Tenebrarum? Like, it's not *just* the Voidcast Dais.)  

The Thirteenth's Moon is geometrically the same as Mare Lamentorum (the Source's Moon). Inset is the map for the latter.

The only differences are the lack of any distinguishing buildings, save for Golbez's keep (middle, what would be the Cradle of Darkness - Zodiark's prison.)  
Bestways Burrows should be to the north, the Watcher's Palace (your first stop upon reaching the moon) to the south-west, Smileton (north-west), and a couple of Loporitt outposts. None of these are present, and apart from some submerged switchbacks in the big northernmost crevasse, nothing to suggest there should be *anything* there.  
Upon reaching rapport, Golbez raises a cuboid arena upon which he, you, and the others borne upon the charm of Azem (in layman's terms, The Duty Finder), fight. There's a cube inside of the cube.

The cube is either reflective, or has a projected texture.

According to Splatoon, this *is* Mare Lamentorum - not a different map at all. I presume the lighting is changed to make everything red, and the buildings are despawned.

I am able to stand on it.  Nothing around the cube has collision. If I attempt to walk off, I am stopped.
