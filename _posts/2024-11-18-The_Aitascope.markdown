Small but cool attention to detail... After completing Abyssos, Pandæmonium emerges into The Aetherial Sea (the setting for *The Aitiascope*, and, incidentally, where the 'Character Select' screen is situated).  
At this point, the Aitiascope itself gains a new blot.

On the subject of The Aetherial Sea, while you can travel down to the start of the duty, you cannot go beyond. Nearly the entirety of the map is loaded, regardless. Here is what this scene would look like from Amon's arena. Center-left is Pandæmonium.

(There's also an extremely conspicuous void where the Mothercrystal would be, if Zenos hadn't eaten it.)
