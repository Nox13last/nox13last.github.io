And now for an extra-special shape.  
I mentioned a while ago about a plugin called 'Hyperborea'. It lets the player load maps they are otherwise not in. I noticed that it has a noclip mode. And my telewalk plugin has gone missing.  

Here's Mordion Gaol.

Way back when (sadly before my time), it was used for an event where you had to bust the Wandering Minstrel out of jail.  
Before, and since, it is a detention cell for players. Players who need to be sequestered for the safety of the game, or to whom the GMs need to speak without interruption (IE, an interrogation), are force-teleported here.  
A player would have their teleportation privileges revoked, and would need to wait to be reintegrated back into the game (or else banned from the game forthwith). If a player logged out here, they would only find themselves logged in here again, waiting to be attended by a GM.

There's nothing remarkable about this place (save for the grim proceedings). What you see is sort of what you get.

Although this seems to be using the event variant, which is programmed to show the Minstrel, and an enemy that had been harassing him.  
Either that, or there's data for NPCs even in the version that sequesters players.
