I am at The Final Day, and I am a little concerned.  
Briefly explaining the battle-flow, you have to Limit Break to survive a mega-buster, but the boss simply rewinds it and plays it back again (a power they abuse liberally throughout the fight). Unable to Limit Break __again__, you watch as the screen fades out in doom, before triumphantly playing a cutaway of everyone wishing upon your little star.  
This cutaway looks to be rendered in-engine, but I can't find it anywhere. Being the sort of thing it is, it would require a cubicle.  
I can't locate it.  

Here's a full-shot of Zenos-Shinryu, though.

And a close-up of one of the planetoids the boss smashes to cause explosions. Despite them just drifting past, you can still see the fractures in the model.  
(Ignore the thing that looks like a *Breath of the Wild* stamina ring. That's a ring around my cursor that helps me keep track of it amidst visual noise.)

I'm bothered that I can't find *the Ragnarok*.
