I am at The Final Day, and I am a little concerned.  
Briefly explaining the battle-flow, you have to Limit Break to survive a mega-buster, but the boss simply rewinds it and plays it back again (a power they abuse liberally throughout the fight). Unable to Limit Break __again__, you watch as the screen fades out in doom, before triumphantly playing a cutaway of everyone wishing upon your little star.  
This cutaway looks to be rendered in-engine, but I can't find it anywhere. Being the sort of thing it is, it would require a cubicle.  
I can't locate it.  

Here's a full-shot of Zenos-Shinryu, though.

And a close-up of one of the planetoids the boss smashes to cause explosions. Despite them just drifting past, you can still see the fractures in the model.  
(Ignore the thing that looks like a *Breath of the Wild* stamina ring. That's a ring around my cursor that helps me keep track of it amidst visual noise.)

I'm bothered that I can't find *the Ragnarok*.  
(Note: These pictures were taken at the end of Duty. This was my 2000th Instance! I earned the 'Lifer' Achievement.)

I've done it. The _Ragnarok_ has been found and, barring Hyperborea breaking the script, I don't know why I was unable to see it in the wild, considering it's where everything else tends to be - 500 units below the ground.

Maybe it had such an extreme cull because the Duty takes place in the void. I don't know at this time at what points (other than the Duty) this is used, as the _Ragnarok_ appears in several cutscenes (to wit: embarking for Ultima Thule, the first re-appearance of Meteion (a lot of good, red, spinning cubes in that one), and also the Staff Roll sequence.)

The _Ragnarok's_ bridge has a crude shape, essentially being made of cardboard. And what serves as the fore of the ship's bridge (where the display consoles might go) cull out much later than the rest. If you look at it from below, it resembles an arrowhead.

_Just in case Zenos forgets which way "forward" is._

Apart from this, the set is very spartan. There is little more here than what the player is expected to see (given that the camera is pulled in way close when the comrades start praying). The below screenshot shows the bridge in pretty much its entirety. The door at the back has absolutely nothing behind it.
There are no actors in this scene (that Splatoon can see), and the chairs at the helm can't be sat in.

_100% bridge. 0% bnnuys._

There's also *this* little console which you don't get to see up close. I think it's the projector that shows the helms-bunnies.

_Not quite the cubes I were thinking of._

Looks almost like a Mahjong Solitaire set. Except the tiles suck and don't seem to be stacked on each other (which is the principal difficulty of that game).
