Oy...  
Jekyll has a <i>really <b>bad</b></i> approach to skins. On a HTML1 Invisionfree (later Zetaboards) site I used to maintain, we used a "skin selector" (to load-in adjacent CSS files, for user preference). That shit would be absolutely out of the question here.  

The skin used here is [Chirpy](https://chirpy.cotes.page/). Really like the chocolate colour, and the scripting used is probably less fragile than anything ChatGPT has spat at me thus far. There's still a bunch of changes to make. I recently quit Twitter, so I will need to remove the social references. Also, the site blurb is gone now. I'll need to figure out where it went and wrassle it back to the front page, or maybe the "About" page, or something.  

I hope you like this skin, dear reader. You're going to fucking get used to it, one way or another. I'm not doing this shlep again.  

Next content update will be about the tools I use. And maybe I'll start publishing about my loathe - <i>Warframe.</i> Look forward to it.
