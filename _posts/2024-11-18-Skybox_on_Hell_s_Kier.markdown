Circle is a shape, especially when concentric (one might even say it's 200% shape). Here is Hells' Kier. Apparently taking place in a hamlet under a volcano (Hells' Lid in the Ruby Sea), Suzaku is mad with grief and mistakes the Warrior of Light for her dead lover, Tenzen, and her grief is so overpowering that it distorts the world into ink murals.

For some reason, rather than have two areas that the party is transported between (for example, the [fight against Nabbles in the Void](https://nox13last.github.io/ffxiv/2024/11/18/The_Chrysalis.html)), the inner geometry is just culled out. All of it. And that seems like it would be nightmarishly inefficient.
