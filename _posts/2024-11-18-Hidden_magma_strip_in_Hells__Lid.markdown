Shapes can be spicy. Here's a strip of magma just outside of Hells' Lid. The user wouldn't see this. It's not like a river-crag feature where it looks like a spring of water from a mountain-face.

I'm a little surprised there are no Dev Cubes. This is also an Instanced Place where much of the Kier storyline (Tenzen and the Auspices) takes place.  
As an interior place, you wouldn't see the sky. It has a skybox though.

I don't know what that thing is. The shape of it implies that it's the moon in waning gibbous. But because it's projected on to the skybox, The camera can't approach it.
