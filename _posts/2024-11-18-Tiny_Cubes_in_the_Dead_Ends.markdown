I've just run through Dead Ends real quick. All of the maps are stacked on top of each other, with the player descending through each one. And I found these weird boxes a little past the Kerillians (the city that gets nuked).  
It's a miracle I was able to see them. They have very small render radii - the one at the back will disappear if I scoot the camera back any further.

The boxes are not airtight. The floor tile is not properly attached to the walls, and the ceiling face is missing completely. The walls and floor seem to be reminiscient of Ostrakon Deka-hepta (the Seventeenth End - the Nibiruni who got bored of life) - the skybox is that of *after* the Ra-la boss fight. But the grass isn't withered.
