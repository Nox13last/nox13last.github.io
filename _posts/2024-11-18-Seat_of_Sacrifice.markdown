The Seat of Sacrifice. Square is a shape. I think it's supposed to be a cube, because the texture is rife with Z-fighting.

As a bonus, as part of the battle flow, the party is banished into a Dimensional Cleft and must break free of their chains to activate Azem's Soulcrystal to call for help. It's a deceptively not-brutal ATB, but harshly punishes the entire group if their **Will of Defiance** bar is empty at the end (so if anyone has RSI, CTS, or some neurological impairment that makes rapid, intense, repetitive motions difficult, the team will struggle).  
The area in which that happens is directly under (and intersecting with) where Amon's theatre would be.

The vague blob at the top left is Elidibus, Warrior of Light, who is about three times the size of a normal person, as *FF* bosses tend to be. That can be your yardstick for the immensity of this sphere.
