I found a row of trees underground.  
![Image](/MorDhona_1.png){: width="600" }
                                                                                                          
And in the distance, the cell that serves as the interior of the Garlond Ironworks workshop.              
![Image](/MorDhona_2.png){: width="600" }  

The only way to get back in there after the first time is to escape the map by using a load-line skip and flying under the geometry.
