Under Phase 2 of The Royal Menagerie. Windows and doors with no architecture around them. I think they correspond to the Palace, seen in the background of the first phase.

And directly underneath the Phase-2 arena (at roughly the same altitide as those fixtures), destroyed, orphaned architecture. Probably remnants of the Phase-1 arena. Things that you can't see from where you'd be now, and in a state you wouldn't see for more than a third of a second, given the lead-up to the Active Time Maneuver.
