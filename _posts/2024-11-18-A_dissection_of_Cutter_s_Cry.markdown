Next up for unused Shapes, we have Cutter's Cry. Pictured is the overall map. Thick blue lines represent the route the player takes on foot. Thin ones represent teleporters.  
![Image](/Cutters_1.png){: width="600" }  
_That's a lot of unused space._

Entire rooms. Like that one at the top left. Big orb. And its only purpose seems to be for you to see about 5% of it through holes in the ceiling.

![Image](/Cutters_3.png){: width="600" } 

In areas that are inaccessible, there are ceruleum puddles, but they look worse than the ones you can reach. I think these are supposed to be overlaid with fire effects.

For comparison:  
![Image](/Cutters_5.png){: width="600" } 

There's a massive bifurcated arena in the middle, separated by a crevasse. Wonder what that was about...
![Image](/Cutters_6.png){: width="600" } 

I am later able to noclip into these areas with the *Hyperborea* plugin (mentioned in the next article). NONE of the areas are in-bounds, meaning they cannot be traversed. Nothing appears when the player approaches. The only collision in the zone is that which the player is allowed to traverse. This map geometry was probably ported over from FFXIV 1.0, like Toto-Rak was.
