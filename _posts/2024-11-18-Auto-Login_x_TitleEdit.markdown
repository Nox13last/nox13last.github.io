I have an auto-login plugin. And it seems to be contraindicating with TitleEdit (the plugin that gives me different title screens).  

![Image](/Title_1.png){: width="600" }  
This title screen is of Sigmascape V1.0 (the Phantom Train). The camera appears to have a corrupted heading (it is facing backward, instead of at the train, as the title demands). The gridline overlay isn't unusual - the auto-login requests the DC, then the server, then the character slot. The gridline is what is presented on the DC select.

No. What I'm interested in is....
