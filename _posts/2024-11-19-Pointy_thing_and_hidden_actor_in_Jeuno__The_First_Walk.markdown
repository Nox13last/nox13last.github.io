(Editor's Note: Only when writing this article did I realise that unrelated parts of the system were failing. *Final Fantasy XIV* mangles print-screens, but I could always rely on ShareX. Until it gave me a thumbs up and told me that it saved each screenshot that I requested, only to then reveal that it never saved them. Even in post-mortem tests, it gave me a thumbnail and a filename to a file that doesn't - and as far as I could tell, never did - exist. Much triage was done through Hyperborea. On with the exhibit...)  

We're already back. My eternal gratitude to the Goatcorp crew. Partly because they told me personally that they don't accept donations, so gratitude is the best they can ask for. (Also a steaming pile on the doorstep of ShareX for not making their app fail-safe.)  
Anyway, it's time for *Shapes: Vana'diel Mini-Edition!*  

It's an interesting one, in my opinion. There is a lot of detail, but the map itself is buttoned-up rather tightly. Entire segments of the map are culled out if you're not there. There's a lot of discrete skyboxes. If you've seen the Euphrosyne article, it's more of that, but some of the skyboxes are shaped like beans.  

Here's a tiny pointy thing just off the edge, in the sea just off the starting area. It's about 1 Unit wide.

Here is the walk to the arena of the second boss - Fafnir. The camera is a couple-hundred units below the ground, and I find it interesting that the two thicket rings seem to use the same model. On the bottom edge of the rings (in relation to the view), there's an identical notch, and the branches themselves form a repeating pattern throughout the rings.

Next, there's a battle with the five bad crystal lads. But Bakool Ja Ja is here as well to deliver a voice line. In fact, they never get rid of him - they just move him into the geometry when the scene is done with him.

This is why it pays to run Splatoon. The `/sf !!*` command will highlight every thing around you, whether it exists at the time or not. Whether it is targetable or not.  If something is programmed to stand there at *some* point in time, Splatoon will point to it and name the actor.  

Because this is a Duty and he is a BattleNpc, he cannot be interacted with. All he does is yell after you when you get zorped into the final boss arena. Unfortunately, I think the writers discovered that he was a bit *too* much of a dick during the Rite of Ascension, so they made him incompetent and meek. Major downgrade, imo.  

Far as I can tell, there's no hidden content in the Vana'diel mini-zone
