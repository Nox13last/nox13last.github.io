This cube seems to lack a floor and ceiling.

Also, it can be seen from the arena (circled in yellow). I wasn't sure if this was because I had taken the camera down there before.

## Discord comments
> K: It must have a render trigger to turn it on, but not one to turn it back off.  
> K: Or... Load trigger or- I don't remember the official term.  
> Me: I don't think there is one? Most people would call it that, or "pop-in radius", something to that effect, I guess.  
> Me I don't remember seeing it before in this one. Not that I was looking, but the backdrop moves rather rapidly, and having something remain static relative to the player would be obvious, regardless of its distance.  
> Me: I see these in different places. And the only pattern I've been able to discern from my sightings is that they're in boss duties whose skybox changes drastically.  
> Me: They're always between one and two player-widths wide (using the targeting circle around my feet as a reference), and always sometimes far below the arena. (Link to Dark Inside)  
>Me: Sometimes they're off to the side... (Links to Paradigm's Breach)  
> Me: Sometimes, there's even two. (Links to Dead Ends)  
>Me: (As a note for The Dead Ends, considering how often the scenery changes (you are said to be shown the titular events of three different planets), they only employ these shenanigans once. Each section of the map (each world) is stored above the one that comes before it, and the scenery change is for after fighting Ra-La, where the verdant grass becomes withered gray, some of the architecture crumbles, and the massive Tree of Life that serves as the backdrop vanishes to make room for the appearance of the Endsinger.)
