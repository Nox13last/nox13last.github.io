**The Drowned City of Skalla** is suspended entirely within a large box, like a greenhorn with a copy of Valve Hammer Editor.

Underneath the anointment altars are rugs. Laterally, they're positioned such that someone standing at the altar would be standing on the rug. But the rug is simply under the ground, and will never be used.

The furniture (in this case, shit you're here to pillage) ascribes to *The Elder Scrolls* model of cropping - if your shit is too tall, don't make something else, just stick it halfway into the ground.
