You know what's also a shape?  
Lasagna.  

Here is the beginning of Ktisis Hyperboreia (the group starts on the right and moves along the path leading through the Desert and Arctic biomes).

Upon beating the boss (in the snowy divot at the bottom-middle), they ascend the Ktisis parking-garage ramp and go through the admin areas.

Then you go up. And up. And up. Until you hit the boundaries of The World Unsundered.

Except the "Up" portion is stored *beneath* the map's ground-floor. As you ascend to the edge of space, you're actually getting closer to the ground floor.

Pictured above: the Exit floor 'Prime Artifice' (bottom-third) where the final boss is fought. Then a void. And then the 'Terrestial Artifice' biomes you spawn in through (upper-third).  

The Prime Artifice is about 1024 vertical metres below the initial spawn.
