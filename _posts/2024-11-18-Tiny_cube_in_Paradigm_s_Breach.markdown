Strange tiny cube way out in the distance in Paradigm's Breach. All of its inner-normals are textured. I remember seeing something like this in the Source engine - when an entity had to speak or transmit (like the Breencasts from Half-Life 2), the speaker would be locked in a studio (a cube in the distance) so they could exist without problems - the lighting-data for the map would break if the map were to be compiled while an entity had access to the void outside.
