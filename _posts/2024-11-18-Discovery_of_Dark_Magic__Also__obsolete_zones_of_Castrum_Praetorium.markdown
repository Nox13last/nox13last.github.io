(This was originally posted on 25 April 2024. It represents my first use of the noclip plugin. It also represents a test of the robustness of the website - there is video media attached, that I have not expressly coded to be viewable. Fuck it, we ball!)  

I have found an *outrageously dangerous* plugin.  

**Just fucking __go__.**

Like, this is a plugin I *definitely* wouldn't use in public. (Editor's Note: I will write about it for public consumption, though. Fight me.)  
For context, this is called a "telewalk". It is, in all classical senses, *a fucking noclip*.  
For the purposes of Shapes Museum, however, it's a perfect way to see and touch more shapes.

Here's a missing shape: The Ceruleum Bulkhead from Praetorium 1.0. It would normally require people striking it for a bit, for Cid to declare that the effort is futile.

You would need to go and get registered to get a Magitek walker (read: Maggie), and come back with it.  
On that note, here's where the keycard would go. The player can't get here normally, but it still shows up with the location fly-in ("Armor Recognition Chamber").

The computer itself is non-functional. You would normally need a keycard from a fallen soldier to operate it. But my tools state that there is no interactive object there under any circumstances.  

The elevator is missing as well, but only because it is already at the top of the shaft. This is where you appear after the colossus (boss 1) fight. Which is an extremely unusual transition...

...because this elevator and that elevator are not remotely connected to each other. Pictured is the plexus between the two. I am standing at the elevator (where Maggie is), top-left. And center-right is where Cid (and that boss) is.

Also, the fly-in for Porta Decumana (the Ultima Weapon arena) still exists, despite now being a separate instance. The post-Ultima arena also still exists. In its entirety.

(The following was posted on 20 August 2024 - some time after the release of the Hyperborea plugin (mentioned in later articles).)  

Well, *this* is interesting.
The Decumana Boss Room is still there. Inside is *still the Ultima Weapon*. As well as an Aether Rift with which to summon Duty Support.  
<center><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nox13last/nox13last.github.io/refs/heads/main/_uploads/Praetorium_8.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nox13last/nox13last.github.io/refs/heads/main/_uploads/Praetorium_8.png" alt="Image" width="600"></a></center>  
Now, wasn't Decumana changed before Duty Support was introduced?

Also, why is the Ultima Weapon internally named 'Borlent'?  
<center><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nox13last/nox13last.github.io/refs/heads/main/_uploads/Praetorium_9.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nox13last/nox13last.github.io/refs/heads/main/_uploads/Praetorium_9.png" alt="Image" width="600"></a></center>  

Apparently, [*this* asshole](https://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/wiki/Borlent) is Borlent? What the fuck is he doing in the Ultima Weapon?  
<center><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nox13last/nox13last.github.io/refs/heads/main/_uploads/Praetorium_11.png"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Nox13last/nox13last.github.io/refs/heads/main/_uploads/Praetorium_11.png" alt="Image" width="600"></a></center>  

He exists as a guard for Fallgourd Float, and is also a minor NPC in the [Endwalker Tank Role Questline](https://ffxiv.gamerescape.com/wiki/Shrouded_in_Peril#Dialogue) (hunting the Blasphemies). **Why the fuck is he in the Ultima Weapon??**  

And finally, the cutscene area, in which Maggie, WoL, and Thancred eventually blast their way through to, to the awe of the Grand Companies leaders. Also, if you're a Legacy Player, where the Leaders finally remember that you were at Cartenaux.

There's nothing down the pipe that serves as the entrance. It turns a corner and then ends abruptly.  

Apparently, Hyperborea was fighting pretty hard to not let my game squeal to the servers. Assuming I don't get banned for this foray (Editor's Note: lol), I'll probably put all of this up on a blog like Cohost or some shit. (Editor's Note: LMAO.)
