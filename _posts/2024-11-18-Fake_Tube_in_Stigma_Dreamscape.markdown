This is your reminder that *tubes* are also shapes. Here's The Stigma Dreamscape, where Omega's dad is still mad at the universe and wants to go beat it up, so, under the advisement of (what would eventually become) the head barista at The Last Dregs caf√©, you turn him off and go into his brain to inceive the idea that he already *did that* and got his ass kicked, because it's better to gaslight someone into thinking they've already lost if there's a chance they could win.  

There's this awesome design in the skybox that you see on the Duty Banner, and it looks like the loading screen to *Phantasy Star Online II* or some shit.

They pulled off the effect extremely well, but it's just a disc. Not even any parallax.

A tiny bit of layering, but at this distance the player is from the design, it doesn't do anything for the illusion.
