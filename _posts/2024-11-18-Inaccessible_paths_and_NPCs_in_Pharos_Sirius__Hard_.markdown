Many shapes are hidden. This tunnel under *Pharos Sirius (Hard)* never opens. Inside, at the end, is a Kobold with no name or action.

And not too far away from it are two Cubes.

In the very next room (to the up-right of the two Cubes here) is another corridor. It also has a Kobold behind the locked door, but upon approaching it, it sends a ``/yell`` chat (so you can hear it) "Where is the escape tunnel?", and then strolls off. It approaches the end of the tunnel and then despawns.  
It's possible that this other Kobold is programmed to do something similar, but it is not possible to approach it.  

As an aside, these walls form part of the Duty's challenge. Sappers are trying to destroy them. You can thwart them, or ignore them and deal with the adds that funnel through. In theory, you could heal the walls. Except it gives an error that doesn't really make sense.

(The coloured lines are just positional markers, and have no relevance. The red slice corresponds to the front of the thing, and the colder colours refer to the backside and flanks. It's good to know that this wall has an ass, even if it's not where one would expect it to be.)  
(Another piece of architecture that has an ass is the Voidgate that shows up during the final boss of Dun Scaith. Considering that it's important to deal as much damage as possible to it, knowing that it has positionals would be useful for RPRs and NINs, whose combat efficacy depends on the concept.)
