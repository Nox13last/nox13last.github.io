For the impromptu fight against the Brute Abominator, there's not actually a whole lot of scenery to look at. Of course, as you're on one of the tallest structures in the skyline, they had to make a little look like a lot.

_Everkeep looks a lot less majestic from here._

And in the final phase of the fight (where you plummet into a building like Sonic the Hedgehog down Speed Highway), the cube lives there.
