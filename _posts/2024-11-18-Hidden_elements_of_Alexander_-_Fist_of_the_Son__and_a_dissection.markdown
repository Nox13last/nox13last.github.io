Some shapes can be pictures (but only as long as they're pictures of shapes). Here is Advanced Clevering (Alexander - The Fist of the Son).

The gimmick revolves around those syringe guns. As the boss does something dangerous, you feed the contraption your aether, and then present yourself to the appropriate syringe, which provides you with a tool to overcome the trial.  
Underneath the map are plates showing what each syringe does. *You cannot see these from the arena.*  

They are:
- Turn the boss into the Hulk.

- Return the boss to normal.

- Turn the player into a Sasquatch.

- Turn the player into an Albatross.

Fortunately, even though you can't see these, a hologram appears above a primed syringe, bearing the latter two emblems.  

As an aside, this room leading towards the boss room is seen earlier in the raid (in The Fist of the Father, I believe). It would look like this, and those cooling towers blast scalding steam out. This is how the player would see it back then, but the camera here is angled __up__ by about 70 degrees.

Here is the layout of that area, with the camera levelled. The cooling towers serve as jump-pads and walkways now.

You'd normally fight a Faust and its adds in this room before moving on (behind the camera) to The Oppressor (and The Oppressor 0.5). Interesting how they never finished the geometry for the backside of this bulkhead because you're not going into this room this time.

No Cubes, bizarrely.
