Two in one day? Dreamin'. This one's about Yuweyawata Field Station - the MSQ Duty, and the short exploration after it. I did _not_ have to make sure I spelled "Yuweyatawa" correctly. I got it right the first time.    

If you go outside to where the boss is and turn around, there is a building jutting out of the mountain above the door you exited through. It's hard not to notice because the game outright focuses on it several times as 'the observatory'. There is nothing inside of that room, but accessible about 100 units below the origin-point of the map is the interior room. It was the first thing I noticed, and there's not really anything remarkable about it.

Those light gangways on the floor are prefabricated geometry, technically seperate from the rest of the floor, and they spread off into the walls and raised parts.

Throughout the Duty, you can see a few odd shapes here and there that make the place seem haunted. There are a few gowned shadows that imply ghosts...

And a few purposely-nondescript guys in tubes.

There are a lot of cells you don't see. The ones that you can't see into are all furnished the same - with a single sink. It looks like a copy-paste job from someone's game of *Prison Architect.*

And finally, there's a Mangled Corpse! I don't know if you're ever allowed to prod it, or if it's ever named by the game. The two entity-markers suggest that an interaction point is placed on top of the Corpse that you're allowed to look at, but I never got the opportunity to see if it was there.
