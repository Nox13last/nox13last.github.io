The inside of the Phantom Train (a little ways below the arena itself). The sights outside of the window are literally just a scrolling texture. The cubes that hold each caboose have a shorter culling distance than each caboose itself.  
The arrangement of furniture in each one appears to be unique between them.

There's also no locomotor on the train *the party* is on. The cabooses duplicate into the distance and then stop.

And at some point, they stop having wheels.

I wish I could check the Phantom Train enemy itself. But it is derailed and removed when defeated.
