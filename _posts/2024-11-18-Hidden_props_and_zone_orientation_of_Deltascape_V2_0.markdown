Here is the Dungeon of Deltascape V2.0, home to the Catastroph[sic] from *Final Fantasy V.*  
![Image](/Delta_V2_1.jpg){: width="600" }


As far as I can tell, every cell is empty, but some have these curious lanterns outside of them. Three tonberries and one mandragora.

The plexus of the arena is strange, with the Dungeons interior above, and the exterior below.

This is natural inclination, by the way. The camera is horizontal. The building is not. Furthermore, it seems to bob and rotate, quite severely at that.

And the back of the building, with a recess for the interior, and a door-box.

# Discord conversation:
> T: **RE: Deltascape 2.0 Object Orientation:** So this arena, for obvious reasons, bears a __striking__ resemblance to the Void arena of **Dissidia 1**, which depicts the same scene. And in __that__ version, much of the geometry was also peculiarly rotated (though I don't remember the pieces actively spinning, something that the PSP may have been incapable of accomplishing). I theorize that SE may have nonetheless recycled the diorama from Dissidia's files and upscaled the textures.  
> Me: I do remember that arena, but I don't think it was upcycled. There was a grass yard around the outside of the tower, which isn't here in FFXIV.
