There's a gap in the crag between The Striking Brand and The Cradle of Darkness (the big crater leading to The Dark Inside) You can take that and then fly through the ravine between the Vallis Vulneris and The Numbing Brand, out of the map.  
Unfortunately, the lowermost collision box (just above The Cradle of Darkness) seems to be all-encompassing. I can't descend to the map-base.

*(One minute passes.)*

**Oh shit, I lied.** The plexus of Bestway Burrows (specifically, The Greatest Endvale) is much lower.  
**I sail.**
