**Science?** *This exact rock* at Island Sanctuary 12.8,27.4,0.5 (map coordinates) has some kind of invalid geometry. I'm stuck dead on it.

The Island Sanctuary seems to have further room to expand. There is a clear path that is blocked off by innocuous rock. It doesn't lead anywhere right now, but there is a void where another cavern *could* exist.

I don't know how old this one is, but there is also a tract of apparently solid geometry leading through a sea-facing cliff. It culls-out if the camera approaches it, so this is the best I can do.
