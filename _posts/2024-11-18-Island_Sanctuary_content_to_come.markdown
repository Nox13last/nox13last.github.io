**Science?** *This exact rock* at Island Sanctuary 12.8,27.4,0.5 (map coordinates) has some kind of invalid geometry. I'm stuck dead on it.

(This was originally posted on 14 June 2023, when Island Sanctuary was on its second version (where the player is allowed to mine out the mountain.). As such, it doesn't reflect the current version.)

The Island Sanctuary seems to have further room to expand. There is a clear path that is blocked off by innocuous rock. It doesn't lead anywhere right now, but there is a void where another cavern *could* exist.

I don't know how old this one is, but there is also a tract of apparently solid geometry leading through a sea-facing cliff. It culls-out if the camera approaches it, so this is the best I can do.

(This was posted on 5 October 2023. This is not an inaccessible area, but it is referenced in the past (above).)  
Called it. This area now exists.
