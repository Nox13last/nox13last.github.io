Man is a shape. There's a sneaky Roland underneath the floor in the Chocobo Square.  
![Image](/GS_1.png){: width="600" }

You need freecam to even target him. But trying to interact with him always only gives a *"Target is too far below you"* error (if you're using the freecam) or *"Unable to execute action from this location"* error (if the camera is above ground or unadulterated).

There is another Roland, and a Spriggan, underneath the Verminion Square.  
![Image](/GS_3.png){: width="600" }  
The former is still too vertically-offset, and the latter is just untargetable.

A Roland wandered in, prattling some idle line. The under-Roland is now untargetable.

I can now speak with the sneaky Roland. He doesn't say anything unusual.

Sneaky Roland under the upstairs bar area.

There is also an active Roland _at_ the bar. So I'm not sure what this one is intended to achieve.
